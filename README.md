# Atmega328p based quadcopter flight controller -  version 0.1

This project is based on Atmega328p microcontroller and MPU6050 IMU sensor. The algorithm is contains a simple PID controller which calculate the error between setpoint and the IMU angle. From that the a stable auto leveling quadcopter is achieved.
